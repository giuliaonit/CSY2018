<h1>Models of Good Practice (MGP) in User Interface (UI) Design</h1>
            <p>
                My inspiration is Callie Schweitzer's personal portofolio website<a href="http://www.callieschweitzer.com/">this one HERE.</a><br><br>
                I liked the fact that it's very simple and has good user interface.
   My choice was this one in order to provide my customers usability and simplicity so they can see the work and the design.
   The website I've choose represents my work which is simple and minimalistic. I’ve chosen this because I want users to have usability.
 My website is designed in such a way that all types of users can accomodate very easily.

 In the design of the product, I focused on what’s significant. The website presents  no distraction, so that the visitors will be more likely to concentrate on what’s important.
 Some of our choices for a simplistic navigation:

 1.	Create just one main navigation menu at the top of the page
 2.	Ensure that navigation is regular throughout the site
 3.	Navigation buttons will be the same size

 The main point I like about this website ist hat it is very intuitive, and the user can see something they’re familiar wit hand access the information about the person who owns that portofolio very easily.
It is very important to be straightforward when it comes to portofolio websites so that the possible customers can find whatever they're looking for easily.
